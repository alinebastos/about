### About Me

I work as front-end developer since 2002. Eight years working with personal and freelance projects as a hobby, and more 
than six years of professional experience. I am passionate for clean, organized and reusable CSS, responsive web development, attention to details, semantic HTML and inclusive cross-browser compatibility. I love working with JavaScript to create accessible and inclusive web applications.
